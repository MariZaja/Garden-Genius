    "description": "Variegated Kiwi Vine, otherwise known as Actinadia Kolomikta 'Arctic Beauty', is an amazing plant species. Its long, dark green, heart-shaped leaves are dazzlingly covered in a mix of white, pink and light green. The foliage is so eye-catching that it's almost like the plant has a unique personality all its own. Its creamy white and pink flowers emerge in late spring and give way to small, fuzzy fruit as late summer approaches. Its growth rate is excellent, quickly covering almost any structure around it with its lush leaves and lush stems. It's also a favorite of pollinators, as its sweet nectarines draw a wide array of insects and birds to its habitat. Variegated Kiwi Vine is truly a beautiful and amazing addition to any landscape \u2013 the perfect choice for adding a touch of magic to your garden!",

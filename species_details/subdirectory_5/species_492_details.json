    "description": "Sneezewort (Achillea ptarmica (The Pearl Group)) is an amazing plant species. It is native to many areas in Europe and Asia and is often planted for its attractive silvery foliage and clusters of white blooms. Its unconventional name comes from its ability to cause allergic reactions upon contact with its volatile essential oils. Its beautiful flower clusters attract a range of pollinators like butterflies and bees, making it a great addition to any garden. It's also known for being an excellent specimen plant and can be grown in clumps, providing a long flowering period with long lasting blooms. Its adaptability and hardiness also means it is easy to grow and maintain. It\u2019s an impressive addition to any garden, and its ability to bring colour and variety to a space is second to none.",
